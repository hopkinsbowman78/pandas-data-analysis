In this challenge, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.



## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge I...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the challenge.
2. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
3. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
4. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
5. Cleaned and tested scripts.
6. Used observations to create analysis.
